# Project-3-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-for-Real-Estate-Pricing.
# Problem Statement
Task is to conduct a comprehensive analysis to identify and 
understand the myriad variables that significantly influence house prices. By leveraging advanced 
data analytics techniques and visualization tools, goal is to uncover patterns, correlations, and 
trends within the dataset, enabling the company to make informed decisions and strategically 
position properties for better business opportunities.
# Situation Overview
The task at hand is to navigate through this complexity 
and extract meaningful insights from the available data.
The ultimate objective is to empower the real estate company with a deeper understanding of the 
market forces at play.
#  Project WorkFlow :-
# 1. Loading the Data:-
 Load the dataset provided in a CSV or Excel format into a Pandas 
DataFrame to facilitate easy manipulation and analysis.
# 2. Cleaning the Data :-
    Ensure data quality by eliminating missing values, removing duplicate 
entries, and addressing any anomalies or inconsistencies in the dataset.
# 3. Univariate Analysis :-
Performed a univariate analysis to understand the distribution of key variables 
like house prices. Utilize histograms, kernel density plots, or other visualizations to gain 
insights into the data.
# 4. Multivariate Analysis :-
Performed multivariate analysis to understand the correlations and 
dependencies between various features. Utilize techniques like correlation matrices or 
scatterplot matrices for a comprehensive view.
# 5. Feature Engineering :-
Introduced new variables that might enhance the model's ability to predict 
house prices. For instance, calculate the price per square foot or engineer a feature 
representing the property's age.
# 6. Customer Preferences and Amenities :-
Examine the dataset to understand how specific amenities (e.g., WoodDeckSF, garage) impact house prices.
# 7. Linear Regression Model
Run the linear regression model and predict the value for the House Price.
# Results and Insights :-
Houses with better quality, larger size, and additional amenities have higher prices. Removing outliers & irrelevant features significantly improved model performance.
